# firecrawl-summarizer

create an app where the user can create new scrape jobs which call firecrawl with this request:

curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v0/crawl \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer fc-1a67435fe4b54212b98f775c0d8fbc21' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://mendable.ai",
      "pageOptions": {
      }
    }'

Once it finishes, it asks gpt 3.5 to summarise the content and categorise it into "quality" of the text.
